    ### DRASTIC Vulnerability Factor Explained
    
    DRASTIC is a standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using hydrogeological factors:
    
    **D** - Depth to water table  
    **R** - Net recharge  
    **A** - Aquifer media  
    **S** - Soil media  
    **T** - Topography  
    **I** - Impact of vadose zone  
    **C** - Hydraulic conductivity  
    
    #### Vulnerability Classes & Factors:
    - **Very High (1.0)**: Sand/gravel aquifers, shallow water table, high permeability
    - **High (0.8)**: Moderate protection, some vulnerability to surface contamination  
    - **Moderate (0.6)**: Mixed geology, moderate protection
    - **Low (0.4)**: Clay layers, deeper water table, good natural protection
    - **Very Low (0.2)**: Dense clay/shale, deep water table, excellent protection
    
    #### Why Different Wells Have Different DRASTIC Scores:
    - **SCHNITZER (0.2 - Very Low)**: Located in area with thick clay/shale layers providing excellent natural protection
    - **BLAKE (0.8 - High)**: Located in area with more permeable geology, higher vulnerability
    - **Geographic Variation**: Oklahoma has diverse geology - eastern areas often have more clay protection, western areas can be more permeable
    
    #### How It Affects Calculations:
    The DRASTIC factor multiplies the base leak probability:
    ```
    Final P_Leak = sigmoid(risk_score) Ã— DRASTIC_factor
    ```
    This means a well with identical risk scores will have different leak probabilities based on local geological protection.
